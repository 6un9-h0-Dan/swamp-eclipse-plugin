This document describes the SWAMP Eclipse plug-in, an extension to the Eclipse IDE that allows users with SWAMP accounts to submit Java code to the SWAMP. Working with the plug-in involves the following steps:

	1. <<appendix-a, Install Eclipse (see Appendix A)>>
	2. <<plug-in-installation, Install the plug-in>>
	3. <<configuration-and-submission, Configure and submit package assessments>>

[[plug-in-installation]]
=== **plug-in installation**
As of now, an end user may only install the plug-in by importing it. To import, follow these steps:
	1. Download the archive from the SWAMP releases page
	2. In your Eclipse installation directory, copy the plug-in archive (".jar") into the "dropins" directory.
	3. Launch Eclipse

=== **configuration and submission**

==== **login**
A user must be logged into his or her SWAMP account to use the plug-in. To log in, a user selects "Log In" from the SWAMP dropdown menu. In the dialog, a user enters his or her username and password. These are the same credentials used for www.mir-swamp.org. The plug-in stores cookies with the user's session information for 24 hours. Similarly, to log out, the user selects "Log Out" instead.

==== **assessment configuration**

Any of the open Java projects in a user's Eclipse workspace may be submitted to the SWAMP. To configure a project, a user simply needs to have some file from the project (e.g. a source code file) active in his or her editor and to select "Configure Assessment Submission" from the SWAMP dropdown menu. If the user is not logged in, the authentication popup will come first allowing the user to authenticate. Once the user is logged in, a dialog with configuration information for the assessment pops up.

==== **configuration options**
	a. SWAMP Project - this is the SWAMP project to which the package belongs (or if it's a new package, the project to which the package will be added). A user can only select from projects he or she has access to
	b. SWAMP Package - this is the SWAMP package of which a version will be uploaded. This also offers the option to "Create new package"
	c. New Package Name - this is the name of the new package that will be uploaded
	d. Package Version - this is the version of the package that will be uploaded. It defaults to a timestamp of the time at which this dialog was opened
	e. Eclipse Project - this is the Java project in the user's workspace whose source will be uploaded
	f. Filepath - this is the filepath of the project directory
	g. Package Type - this is the SWAMP package type of the package
	h. Build System - this is the build system of the project. If a user selects "Auto-generate build file", the plug-in will create a build file for building the project.
	i. Package System Libraries? - this option allows users to upload the system libraries that Eclipse uses for this project to the SWAMP along with the package. This sets the bootclasspath for the Java compiler
	j. Build File - this is the path of the build file to be used (in the case that the plug-in is not auto-generating the build file)
	k. Build Target - this is the target to build the project (in the case that the plug-in is not auto-generating the build file)

==== **tool selection**
Next, a user must select the tools he or she wishes to run the assessments on

==== **platform selection**
Finally, a user must select the platforms he or she wishes to run the assessments on

==== **submission**

After a user clicks "OK" in the dialog for selecting platforms, a background job is launched. The user's console will have messages from the plug-in's execution.

The plug-in saves previous assessment information about each Eclipse project. Instead of using the configuration dialogs, a user may resubmit an assessment in one of three ways:
	1. Have a file from the project open in the editor and click the SWAMP button
	2. Right-click on the project on Package Explorer and click "Assess Project on SWAMP"
	3. Have a file from the project open and select "Resubmit Previous Assessment" from either the dropdown menu or the SWAMP menu in the main menubar
