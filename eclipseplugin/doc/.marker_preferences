# This file allows a user to configure the color and shape of the marker that
# appears for a bug based on the bug's tool, group, and severity. Lines that
# begin with "#" will be ignored. This file lists mappings from a
# colon-delimited regular expression in the format "tool:bug_group:bug_severity"
# to color-shape pairs (e.g. "red-circle"). There must be two spaces between
# the regular expression and its corresponding color. If a bug does not match 
# any of the regular expressions in this file, it will have a black circle 
# marker. This file should be saved in $HOME/.SWAMP_SETTINGS/.marker_preferences
#
# The available colors are red, yellow, green, black, blue, orange, purple,
# gray, and white.
# The only available shape at this time is circle.
