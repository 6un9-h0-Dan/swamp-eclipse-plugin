Demo with SWAMP Dev Staff

Feedback
-Have one button to repeat an existing assessment
-Allow multiple tools to be chosen at once
    -Allow multiple platforms to be chosen at once (lower priority)
-Allow different versions of Java to be chosen (?)
-Allow selection of different packages from the SWAMP
    -This doesn't make sense to me since the end user should have the project open in their workspace
-Add feedback for the end user
    -For example, we need to have information on whether the upload was successful
    -Bolo suggested putting feedback in the monitor view
