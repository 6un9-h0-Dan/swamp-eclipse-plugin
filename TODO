TODO:
-Test automatic export
-Test assessment submission in general
-Add handling for when assessment results come in (?)

-Keep information about previous assessments
-Add feedback for the user (Bolo suggested feedback in the Monitor view)

-Stop copying over Java run-time (rt.jar) - this is very expensive
