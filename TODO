TODO:
-Test automatic export
-Test assessment submission in general
-Add handling for when assessment results come in (?)

-Add feedback for the user (Bolo suggested feedback in the Monitor view)

-(?) Stop copying over Java run-time (rt.jar) - this is very expensive
-Make "Clear" buttons for SelectionDialog, ConfigDialog, and maybe AuthenticationDialog
    -This will be easy. Just call resetState() and write a resetWidgets() method to reset the List, Combo, and Text widgets

-Get cookies working properly (Vamshi's working on this)

-Programmatically determine the type of Eclipse project and as much build as possible
    -e.g. if it's a Maven project in Eclipse, set that as the build system and populate the build info
