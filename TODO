TODO:
-Test automatic export
-Test assessment submission in general
-Add handling for when assessment results come in (?)

-(?) Stop copying over Java run-time (rt.jar) - this is very expensive

-Programmatically determine the type of Eclipse project and as much build as possible
    -e.g. if it's a Maven project in Eclipse, set that as the build system and populate the build info

-Refactor dialogs/selection dialogs (interface/inheritance)

DONE:
-Add sensible default behaviors (e.g. if there's only one project, that should be the project selected)
-Add Combo for SWAMP package to Config Dialog - this way we won't always submit a new package
-Get cookies working properly (Vamshi's working on this)
