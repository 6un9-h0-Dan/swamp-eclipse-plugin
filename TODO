TODO:

Immediate:
-Queueing background jobs
-Handling nested projects
-Add login/logout functionality when functionality has been added to SwampApiWrapper
-Make portable
-Use smaller SWAMP icon
-More descriptive console messages (time-stamped and with Project and Package names)

Testing:
-Test automatic export
-Test assessment submission in general
-Add handling for when assessment results come in (?)
-Test on Windows

Future:
-Add an about option to the dropdown menu, that says who I am and what the SWAMP is
-(?) Capture files at the time submitted rather than when they're going to be processed, particularly if there's a queue
-(?) Programmatically determine the type of Eclipse project and as much build as possible
    -e.g. if it's a Maven project in Eclipse, set that as the build system and populate the build info
-(?) Stop copying over dependencies that the SWAMP can get over the network (e.g. Maven central dependencies)
-(?) Keep a persistent .swampbin and check the timestamp on the different libraries to figure out whether they need to be re-copied over. This would result in HUGE savings

===================================================================================================
DONE:
-Add sensible default behaviors (e.g. if there's only one project, that should be the project selected)
-Add Combo for SWAMP package to Config Dialog - this way we won't always submit a new package
-Get cookies working properly (Vamshi's working on this)
-1 button to resubmit previous assessments
-Stop copying over Java run-time (rt.jar) - this is very expensive
-Add an option on the project to submit it to the SWAMP
-Having serialized config files for each individual project (?)
-Minor UX improvements from SWAMP API improvements (only showing tools/platforms for a given language, checking tool-platform pair compatibility before submitting)
