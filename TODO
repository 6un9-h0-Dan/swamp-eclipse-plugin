TODO:

Immediate:
-Queueing background jobs
-1 button to resubmit previous assessments
-Add an option on the project to submit it to the SWAMP
-Minor UX improvements from SWAMP API improvements (only showing tools/platforms for a given language, checking tool-platform pair compatibility before submitting)
-Handling nested projects

Testing:
-Test automatic export
-Test assessment submission in general
-Add handling for when assessment results come in (?)

Future:
-(?) Stop copying over Java run-time (rt.jar) - this is very expensive
-(?) Programmatically determine the type of Eclipse project and as much build as possible
    -e.g. if it's a Maven project in Eclipse, set that as the build system and populate the build info
-Refactor dialogs/selection dialogs (interface/inheritance)
-(?) Stop copying over dependencies that the SWAMP can get over the network (e.g. Maven central dependencies)
-(?) Keep a persistent .swampbin and check the timestamp on the different libraries to figure out whether they need to be re-copied over. This would result in HUGE savings

===================================================================================================
DONE:
-Add sensible default behaviors (e.g. if there's only one project, that should be the project selected)
-Add Combo for SWAMP package to Config Dialog - this way we won't always submit a new package
-Get cookies working properly (Vamshi's working on this)
